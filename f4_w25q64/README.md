Tentitive STM32F4 builds for the Winbond W25Q64 / W25QL64 class devices

Adding in some ST .STLDR and Keil .FLM to the experiment here

  *  PF10,PB6, PF8,PF9,PF7,PF6
     *  https://github.com/cturvey/stm32extldr/blob/main/f4_w25q64/CLIVEONE-W25Q64_STM32F4XX-PF10-PB6-PF8-PF9-PF7-PF6.stldr

These are tentitve builds awaiting more testing/feedback

For Keil .FLM make sure at least 52KB RAM selected for algorithms, and .FLM filename is 31 characters or less

The RAM available for the Flash Algorithm should be as large as possible to accomodate the size of the loader
